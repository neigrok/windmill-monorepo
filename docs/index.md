# Flow index

Where each user flow is drawn. Each section reads left to right; every board's caption names the code
that ships it. Status lives in the Figma layer names. Gym on iOS and Android is indexed here so far.

## Gym · iOS

Figma: Gym file, page [iOS](https://www.figma.com/design/vdmdiKWrmZoS1FtcvJRf6O?node-id=11-2).
Code: `apps/ios/App/Sources/Gym/`. Colour roles: [ios-redesign.md](design/ios/ios-redesign.md).
The page is the target: 🚀 boards match the app, 🚧 boards are what the next build draws, and each
target holds the slot and number of the board it replaced ([consistency.md](design/consistency.md)
10o, 10p, 10q, 10r, 12a–12j).
